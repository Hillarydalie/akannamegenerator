          Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture.
          Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which
          corresponds to the day in the week they were born. These names are commonly 
          reffered to as <em>Akan Names </em>.

          Most people do know when their birthdays are, but some might not know what
          day of the week they were born. Luckily for you, thanks to me, there is a way for you to calculate the day
          of the week from a specific date. The following is one of the many methods 
          that exist for that. This application will use your information, mainly your date of birth and gender
          to generate you "Akan" name.
